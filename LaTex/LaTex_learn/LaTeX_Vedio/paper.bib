	abstract = {This paper is a survey of the theory and methods of photogrammetric bundle adjustment, aimed at potential implementors in the computer vision community. Bundle adjustment is the problem of reﬁning a visual reconstruction to produce jointly optimal structure and viewing parameter estimates. Topics covered include: the choice of cost function and robustness; numerical optimization including sparse Newton methods, linearly convergent approximations, updating and recursive methods; gauge (datum) invariance; and quality control. The theory is developed for general robust cost functions rather than restricting attention to traditional nonlinear least squares.},

	abstract = {In this research, a non-infrastructure-based and low-cost indoor navigation method is proposed through the integration of smartphone built-in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) sensors and indoor map information using an auxiliary particle ﬁlter (APF). A cascade structure Kalman particle ﬁlter algorithm is designed to reduce the computational burden and improve the estimation speed of the APF by decreasing its update frequency and the number of particles used in this research. In the lower ﬁlter (Kalman ﬁlter), zero velocity update and non-holonomic constraints are used to correct the error of the inertial navigation-derived solutions. The innovation of the design lies in the combination of upper ﬁlter (particle ﬁlter) map-matching and map-aiding methods to further constrain the navigation solutions. This proposed navigation method simpliﬁes indoor positioning and makes it accessible to individual and group users, while guaranteeing the system’s accuracy. The availability and accuracy of the proposed algorithm are tested and validated through experiments in various practical scenarios.},

	abstract = {In this work we address robust estimation in the bundle adjustment procedure. Typically, bundle adjustment is not solved via a generic optimization algorithm, but usually cast as a nonlinear leastsquares problem instance. In order to handle gross outliers in bundle adjustment the least-squares formulation must be robustiﬁed. We investigate several approaches to make least-squares objectives robust while retaining the least-squares nature to use existing eﬃcient solvers. In particular, we highlight a method based on lifting a robust cost function into a higher dimensional representation, and show how the lifted formulation is eﬃciently implemented in a Gauss-Newton framework. In our experiments the proposed lifting-based approach almost always yields the best (i.e. lowest) objectives.},

	abstract = {Camera-based localization techniques must be robust to correspondence errors, i.e., when visual features (landmarks) are matched incorrectly. The two primary techniques to address this issue are RANSAC and robust M-estimation –each more appropriate for different applications. This paper investigates the use of different robust cost functions for Mestimation to deal with correspondence outliers, and assesses their performance under varying degrees of data corruption. Experimental results show that using an aggressive redescending cost function (e.g., Dynamic Covariance Scaling (DCS) or Geman-McClure (G-M)) best improves accuracy by excluding outliers almost entirely. Additionally, adjusting an error-scaling parameter for the robust cost function over the course of the optimization improves convergence with poor initial conditions.},

This paper describes the general structure of such problems and presents g2o, an open-source C++ framework for optimizing graph-based nonlinear error functions. Our system has been designed to be easily extensible to a wide range of problems and a new problem typically can be speciﬁed in a few lines of code. The current implementation provides solutions to several variants of SLAM and BA. We provide evaluations on a wide range of real-world and simulated datasets. The results demonstrate that while being general g2o offers a performance comparable to implementations of stateof-the-art approaches for the speciﬁc problems.},
